# ✅ Final Setup Checklist for Invoice Generator

## 🎯 What You Need to Do

### 1. Create Missing Files

You need to create these files in your project directory:

#### **db.js** (Root directory)
- Copy the content from the "db.js - Database Setup" artifact
- This file initializes your SQLite database and creates all tables
- It also inserts sample data automatically

#### **routes/change-orders.js**
- Copy the content from the "routes/change-orders.js" artifact
- This handles change order management

#### **.env** (Root directory)
- Create this file with your actual credentials:
```env
PORT=3000
NODE_ENV=development

# IONOS SMTP Configuration
SMTP_HOST=smtp.ionos.com
SMTP_PORT=587
SMTP_SECURE=false
SMTP_USER=m19u3l@sd-bcs.com
SMTP_PASS=Psswrd2025!

# Email Settings
EMAIL_FROM_NAME=Miguel
EMAIL_FROM_ADDRESS=m19u3l@sd-bcs.com

# Database
DATABASE_PATH=./invoice.db

# Company Info
COMPANY_NAME=SD-BCS
COMPANY_EMAIL=m19u3l@sd-bcs.com
```

### 2. Update Your server.js

Your server.js needs a small update. Change this line:
```javascript
import { dbPromise } from './db.js';  // Add this import
```

And update the PDF/Email routes to use the imported dbPromise instead of creating a new one.

### 3. File Structure Verification

Make sure your project has this structure:

## 🚀 Step-by-Step Setup

### Step 1: Create db.js
```bash
# In your project root directory
touch db.js
# Then paste the content from the "db.js - Database Setup" artifact
```

### Step 2: Create .env
```bash
# In your project root directory
touch .env
# Then add your credentials (see above)
```

### Step 3: Create change-orders.js
```bash
# In your routes directory
touch routes/change-orders.js
# Then paste the content from the artifact
```

### Step 4: Install Dependencies (if not done)
```bash
npm install
```

### Step 5: Start the Server
```bash
# For development with auto-reload
npm run dev

# OR for production
npm start
```

### Step 6: Verify It's Working
You should see:
```
✅ Database initialized successfully
✅ Sample data inserted (or "Sample data already exists")
✅ Server running on port 3000
```

### Step 7: Test the API
```bash
# Test if server is responding
curl http://localhost:3000/api/clients

# Test dashboard stats
curl http://localhost:3000/api/dashboard/stats

# Create a test client
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/clients \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name":"Test Client","email":"test@example.com"}'
```

## 🐛 Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: "Cannot find module './db.js'"
**Solution:** Make sure you created the `db.js` file in the root directory (same level as server.js)

### Issue 2: "SQLITE_CANTOPEN: unable to open database"
**Solution:** 
- Check file permissions in your project directory
- Make sure you have write access
- Try: `chmod 755 .` in your project directory

### Issue 3: Email not sending
**Solution:**
- Verify your IONOS password in `.env`
- Check if SMTP is enabled in your IONOS account
- Try port 465 with `SMTP_SECURE=true` if 587 doesn't work

### Issue 4: "Address already in use" (Port 3000)
**Solution:** 
- Change PORT in `.env` to another port (e.g., 3001)
- Or kill the process using port 3000: `lsof -ti:3000 | xargs kill -9`

### Issue 5: PDF generation not working
**Solution:**
- Verify all dependencies installed: `npm install`
- Check PDFKit is properly installed: `npm list pdfkit`
