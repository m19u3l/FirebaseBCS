✅ What You ALREADY HAVE:
1. Remediation/Dryout Module:

Water damage categories (Cat 1, 2, 3)
Equipment tracking (air movers, dehumidifiers)
Moisture readings and monitoring
Demolition documentation (carpet, drywall, baseboards removal with measurements)
Antimicrobial treatment logs
Deodorization tracking
Date tracking (loss date, inspection, start, completion)

2. Reconstruction Module:

Complete trade-by-trade documentation for:

Demolition, Framing, Plumbing, Electrical, HVAC
Insulation, Drywall, Painting, Trim
Doors, Windows, Flooring, Tile
Cabinetry, Countertops, Specialty work


Each trade captures measurements, materials, labor hours

3. Basic Estimate Generation:

Creates Xactimate-format estimates from the documented work
Tracks labor, materials per trade


❌ What's MISSING (What you want to add):
The Xactimate-Style Pricing Database:

Pre-populated pricing for every item (like Xactimate's library)
Take measurements → automatically calculate costs
Pricing includes:

Labor rates by trade
Material costs
Overhead %
Tool/equipment wear & tear
Profit margin
Real-time quote generation



Example of what you want:
You measure: 150 sqft of water-damaged drywall
System calculates:
- Remove drywall: 150 sqft × $X.XX = $XXX
- Dispose: 150 sqft × $X.XX = $XX
- New drywall: 150 sqft × $X.XX = $XXX
- Tape/mud: 150 sqft × $X.XX = $XXX
- Labor: X hours × $XX/hr = $XXX
- Overhead (15%): $XX
- Profit (20%): $XXX
= TOTAL QUOTE: $X,XXX
Is this correct? You want to add the pricing intelligence so measurements automatically become dollar amounts? 💰दोबारा कोशिश करेंKi want it to be likewhat the insurance companies use but this is 1 already finished ✅ FINAL SETUP - Insurance Restoration System

📁 Files You Need to Create
1. Update db.js
Your current db.js needs to include the new remediation tables. Replace your db.js with this enhanced version:
Add these tables to your database initialization (in the db.exec() section):// Add to your existing db.js file after the current tables:

Now you want to build the next level - the Xactimate-compatible pricing database that insurance companies actually use.
🎯 What You Want to Build Next:
An Xactimate Price List Database that includes:

Line Item Codes (like Xactimate uses)

Example: DEM DWALL = Demolish Drywall
Example: INS DWALL = Install Drywall
Example: RMV CPTI = Remove Carpet & Pad


Unit Pricing (matched to Xactimate's San Diego pricing)

Labor cost per unit
Material cost per unit
Equipment cost per unit
Total cost per unit


Units of Measure

Square Feet (SF)
Linear Feet (LF)
Each (EA)
Cubic Yard (CY)
Hour (HR)


Categories/Trades

Demolition
Rough Carpentry
Drywall
Painting
Flooring
Plumbing
Electrical
Equipment/Drying




🔥 Here's What I'll Build for You:
"Xactimate Price List Database" - A comprehensive pricing system where:
✅ You enter measurements (150 sqft drywall damage)
✅ System looks up the price list
✅ Automatically calculates:

Demolition costs
Material costs
Labor costs
Equipment rental (if applicable)
Overhead %
Profit %
✅ Generates insurance-ready estimate with line items


Should I create:

The pricing database schema (SQL tables for all line items)?
A sample price list with common restoration items (San Diego pricing)?
The quote generator interface that uses these prices?

Or all three? 💪

🎯 How to Use It:
Example Quote Calculation:
Job: Water damage - 500 SF drywall removal + replacement

1. Remove drywall 4ft: 500 SF × $0.60 = $300
2. Dispose drywall: 5 CY × $20 = $100
3. Hang new drywall: 500 SF × $1.05 = $525
4. Tape & mud level 4: 500 SF × $1.03 = $515
5. Texture knockdown: 500 SF × $0.65 = $325
6. Prime walls: 500 SF × $0.55 = $275
7. Paint 2 coats: 500 SF × $1.16 = $580

Subtotal: $2,620
Tool Depreciation (5%): $131
Overhead (15%): $413
Profit (15%): $474

TOTAL: $3,638
